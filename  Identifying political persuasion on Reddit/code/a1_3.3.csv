Both "first-person pronouns" and "Number of future tense verbs" were chosen at low and high amounts of input. I think the reason why is that political users tend to use more future tense verbs.
The p-values are generally higher given more data. I think the reason being that more data reduces bias.
 "first-person pronouns", "Number of future tense verbs", "receptiviti_cooperative", "receptiviti_intellectual" and receptiviti_sexual_focus.  intelluctauls and people who are more cooperative are (i think ) key features in differentiating political positions. intelluctauls especially because they may give more information on which position they stand politically.
