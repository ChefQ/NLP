with epsilon = 0.0  and M=8
maxIter = 1 accuracy = 0.96875
maxIter = 5 accuracy = 1.0
maxIter = 10 accuracy = 1.0
maxIter = 15 accuracy = 1.0

with epsilon = 0.0  and maxIter =15
M=1 accuracy = 1.0
M=2 accuracy = 1.0
M=4 accuracy = 1.0
M=8 accuracy = 1.0

with M=8 and maxIter =15
epsilon = 200.0 accuracy = 0.96875
epsilon = 600.0 accuracy = 0.96875
epsilon = 800.0 accuracy = 1
epsilon = 5000.0 accuracy = 0.9375

changing epsilon has a significant change in accuracy compared to the rest of the variables.
Q1:
I would increase the number of M. This will allow my distribution to be more robust.

Q2: I would make threshold such that at least all of the potential model's log likelihood  must me greater than. If none of the models is greater than such threshold, then the classifier can conclude that a given test utterance doesn't come from any of the trained speaker models

Q3:I would use a hidden markov model Neural Network to get the job done
